# Sequence Comparison
To build the project you must first use the command `make
build`. Then, you can either run the alignment of a set of test
sequences with the command `make sample`, or, you can run on the two
virus sequences with the command `make run`.

To view the alignment results open/view the contents of
`aligned_sequences.txt`.
